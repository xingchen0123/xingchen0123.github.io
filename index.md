## About Me

Hi! I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I am an empiricist working on topics including **Public Opinion, Environmental Governance, and Political Economy**, with the regional focus on China. Currently I am particularly interested in studying how personal experience, learning capacity, and information disclosure result in heterogeneous public attitudes towards public policies.

## Working Papers
- *Pollution Matters: The Political Cost of Information Disclosure (First and Corresponding author with [Xiaoxiao Shen](https://xiaoxiaoshen.co/) and Andong Zhuge). Under Review, [[Read]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4486089).*
  
  Abstract: This paper examines the causal impact of information disclosure on political trust and provides a possible psychological mechanism through which the effect occurred. Using a Difference-in-Difference strategy, this paper examines the causal effect of environmental information disclosure on political trust, by looking into a staggered rolled-out implementation of a national program in China that provides real-time air-pollution information to the public. We found that the information disclosure had a significantly positive impact on citizens’ political trust. However, this positive “disclosure effect” was moderated by the local pollution levels residents were exposed to. Notably and surprisingly, the adverse impact was more pronounced for less polluted areas. Our heterogeneity analysis also showed that the effect is more pronounced among middle-aged, internet using, and urban residents with children. Furthermore, we established that the causal effect operated through the channels of citizens’ mental well-being, demonstrated by a large and statistically significant increase in the risk of mild depression and self-dissatisfaction.
  
- *The impact of grassroot democracy on hierarchical government trust in rural China (First author  with [Yuanyuan Yi](https://sites.google.com/view/yuanyuanyi/home), [Jintao Xu](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/x/239550.htm) and Andong Zhuge). submitted.[[Read]](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/cbw/tlg1/tlg2023/index.htm))*
  
  Abstract: This study explores how the application of the democratic rule in grassroot decision-making process determines villagers’ political trust in land reform in rural China. We use a two-wave household survey data and find that in China’s most recent Collective Forest Tenure Reform, the use of democratic rule improves villagers’ trust for town and county cadres, whereas its impact on trust towards village cadres is not significant. This pattern of trust is partly explained by our findings that the democratic process helped decrease the unresolved inter-village forestland disputes which usually requires town or county level cadres’ to intervene, whilst there seems no such impact on the within-village land disputes. Heterogeneity analyses show that the use of the democratic rule in decision-making process has a more pronounced effect in improving trust for lower-income, and household without affiliation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or to the village committee. Our results provide the first evidence that Chinese people perceive democracy not only as a way to select their leaders, but also ways for ordinary people to participate in public affairs and present their opinions in decision-making process to influence local cadres’ accountability in Chinese grassroots democracy.

- *Understanding Compliance with Zero-COVID Policy: Who Will Blindly Obey, and Who Will Disobey?*
  
    Abstract:The debate about the optimal policy to deal with a pandemic is yet to be settled. Against the backdrop that the clamor in social media always dominates the public sphere, it is of great importance to know the attitudes of the general public towards COVID policies. With a two-wave survey conducted in seven cities in China in September 2022 and January 2023 - the month before and after China relaxed its COVID policy, we provide a detailed analysis of public preferences towards the zero-COVID policy with 7,000 valid responses. The results show that: (1) the choice of policy is shaped by individuals' perceptions of the associated costs and benefits, at both the self and societal levels. Also, respondents’ perceptions of self and societal cost for COVID policy are notably aligned; (2) experiences (economic loss and infection of COVID-19) greatly shape respondents' perceived cost and benefit for COVID policies; (3) The preference for zero-COVID varies across sociodemographic groups, specifically, people with a higher level of trust in government, higher level of risk aversion, , are significantly more likely to be zero-COVID supporters.

- *Learning Through Infection*

  Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented governmental restrictions to personal movement freedoms. This paper investigates how individual-level infection experiences shape mass support for the restrictive policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing theories of affect and decision making, we test our hypotheses in China using panel data which allow us to identify the role of infection in support for restrictive policies while controlling for individual heterogeneity. Our findings reveal that experiencing infection of Covid-19 had a negative impact on supporting restrictive measures (zero-COVID policy), whereas lockdown experiences had a limited impact. Notably, the findings indicate that the infection severity moderate the impact of infection, a key variable for supporting the zero-COVID policy. Specifically, higher infection severity was associated with greater acceptance of zero-COVID policy. Additionally, infection experiences substantially decreased personal risk preference. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which citizens swiftly decide to sacrifice their civil liberties in response to health risks.
