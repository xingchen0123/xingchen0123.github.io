## About Me

Hi! I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I am an empiricist focusing on **environmental economics, public opinion, and political economy**. Currently I am particularly interested in studying how personal experience, learning capacity, and information disclosure result in heterogeneous public attitudes towards public policies.
