## About Me

Hi! My name is Xing Chen (陈醒). I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/xingchen/zh_CN/index.htm) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I obtained my PhD in Environmental Economics and bachelor degree in Environmental Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My advisor was Professor [Jintao Xu](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/x/239550.htm) from [National School of Development](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/index.htm). Additionally, I spent a year as a visiting scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu/), supervised by the esteemed environmental economist, [Peter Berck](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/peter-berck).

My experience at Shanghai ignited my interest in politics and diverted me from my initial academic path. I now study **Public Policy (mainly environment policy), Political Economy, Public Opinion, and Political Psychology**. Leveraging observations from the real world, I provide evidence-based insights into how information, trauma, and cultural norms shape political trust and policy compliance. My research connects public policy/administration, political science, and economics, with work published in  **Governance**, **Public Performance&Management Review**. If you want to collaborate, feel free to email me.
