## About Me

Hi! My name is Xing Chen (陈醒, [meaning of my first name](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%86%92#Definitions)). I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I obtained my PhD in Environmental Economics and bachelor degree in Environmental Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My advisor was Professor [Jintao Xu](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjs/x/262188.htm#) from [National School of Development](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/xygk/xygk1/index.htm). Additionally, I spent a year as a visiting scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu/), supervised by Professor [Peter Berck](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/peter-berck).

My experiences in Shanghai ignited my interest in politics. My current research focuses on public opinion and political economy under authoritarianism. Drawing on real-world observations, I provide empirical insights into how information, trauma, and psychocultural factors shape political trust and decision-making. I am particularly interested in how the collective unconscious subtly distorts people’s perceptions of new information.

My research has appeared or is forthcoming in ***Governance, Journal of Development Economics, and World Development***, among other journals.
