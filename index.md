## About Me

Hi! My name is Xing Chen(陈醒). I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I obtained my PhD in Environmental Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), the top 1 university in China, where I also received my bachelor degree in Environmental Science. My advisor was Professor [Jintao Xu](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/x/239550.htm) from [National School of Development](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/aboutus/about/index.htm). Additionally, I was a visiting scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu/) from 2017 to 2018, supervised by the esteemed environmental economist, [Peter Berck](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/peter-berck).

My experience at Shanghai ignited my interest in Politics, a field distinct from my formal academic training. However, through self-study, currently I am working on topics including **Environmental Politics, Public Opinion, and Political Economy**, with the regional focus on China. I provide evidence-based insights into how information, trauma, and cultural norms shape political attitudes and decision making of individuals in authoritarian settings, where behavior is predominantly driven by profound fear and a strong desire for validation, arising from persistent unmet emotional needs. My research has appeared or is forthcoming in **Governance**, **Public Performance&Management Review**, among others. If you want to collaborate, please feel free to email me.

- Land Reform, Emerging Grassroots Democracy and Political Trust: Evidence from China’s Collective Forest Tenure Reform (First author  with [Yuanyuan Yi](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/szdw/yjyxl/y6/515466.htm#), [Jintao Xu](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjs/x/262188.htm) and Andong Zhuge).[[ssrn]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4569967) [[CCER讨论稿]](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/cbw/tlg1/tlg2023/532016.htm)[[slides]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o7tx7fdd3x5c5ai8t8bb9/democracy.pdf?rlkey=qrj4w4arrqbkjodd9td8wq86d&dl=0)
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This study explores how the application of democratic rule in land reform decision-making process determines villagers’ political trust towards different levels of the cadres in rural China. Based on analyses of a two-period household survey, we find that in China’s most recent Collective Forest Tenure Reform, the use of democratic rule improves villagers’ trust for town and county cadres, whereas the impact on trust towards village cadres is only significant for the highest democraticness that involves mass participation. This pattern of trust is partly explained by that the democratic process helped decrease the unresolved inter-village forestland disputes which usually requires town or county level cadres’ intervene, whilst there seems no such impact on the within-village land disputes. Heterogeneity analyses show that democratic decision-making has a more pronounced effect in improving trust for villagers with lower income, and those without affiliation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or to the village committee. Our results provide the first evidence that Chinese people perceive democracy not only as a way to select their leaders, but also ways for ordinary people to participate in public affairs and present their opinions in decision-making process to influence local cadres’ accountability.

- The Dynamics of Public Opinion on COVID-19 Policies in China

  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   Understanding citizen compliance in rapidly evolving policy environment is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of public health strategies, especially in scenarios like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the dynamics of public opinion regarding the shift from zero-COVID policy to live-with-COVID policy, utilizing a two-wave panel survey conducted in August 2022 and January 2023 in China. We find substantial support for zero-COVID initially (79.42%), which persisted significantly (45.73%) after policy relaxation. Sociodemographic factors demonstrated limited impact on policy support, with the exception of iOS users. Moreover, individuals’ attitudes toward policies are associated with their perceived cost and benefit of COVID policies. This indicates that people are actively assessing the impact of each policy on their personal lives rather than passively accepting government directives, and this also nullifies the self-sensor hypothesis. Additionally, the correlation between the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and support for the zero-COVID policy highlights the impact of personal experience on public opinion. These results reveal the heterogeneous preferences towards zero-COVID policies in China.

- From Scarcity to Spike: The Impact of Childhood Famine Trauma on Fiscal Expenditure Behavior (Corresponding author with Andong Zhuge). [[ssrn]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4646240)[[slides]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t819mhqoujxse6sr7pw0s/trauma.pdf?rlkey=a9t50sj9rtcagp90wfre37dfj&dl=0) 
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This study delves into the understudied nexus between officials’ personal trauma experiences and their fiscal decision-making, with a particular emphasis on childhood famine experiences and the inclination toward fiscal conservatism. Using data from Chinese cities spanning 2008 to 2018, we find that officials imprinted with childhood famine trauma demonstrate a significant increase in Year-End Spending Spikes (YESS), a phenomenon characterized by a rush to exhaust surplus budgets at year end due to “use it or lose it” budget rule. This behavior correlates with a decrease in both GDP growth rate and fiscal efficiency. Furthermore, the imprint effect is pronounced among officials who endured famine between ages 3 to 8, suggesting a critical window of impressionable years. Moreover, working in cities less reliant on financial transfers, and extensive local networks accentuate this effect. We further explore the psychological mechanisms, highlighting a correlation between mild depression and fiscal behavior, thus providing new insights into the profound and enduring effects of early trauma on public financial management.

- “The Voice of Extravagance”: Evidence from Cross-Border Media Exposure in Pearl River Delta(Corresponding author with [Renji Zhou](https://ii.umich.edu/ii/people/all/r/renjizh.html))
    <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This study investigates the long-term impact of non-political media on political attitudes, utilizing the accidental introduction of cross-border television signals in early 1980s China as a natural experiment. Our findings reveal that rural residents in counties with stronger reception of Hong Kong’s free-to-air TV (HKTV), particularly TVB, exhibit lower political trust in local governments. This effect persists for two decades, and is predominantly observed among heavy TV viewers – cohorts who were exposed to HKTV during their adolescence. Regarding possible mechanisms, we find that individuals exposed to entertainment television in their formative years tend to be more civic-minded as adults. They demonstrate heightened awareness of social issues, yet their general cognitive sophistication does not correspondingly increase. This study contributes to understanding the subtle yet significant impact of entertainment media on political perceptions and civic engagement.
