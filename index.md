## About Me

Hi! My name is Xing Chen(陈醒). I am an assistant professor at [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I am an empirical researcher, working on topics including **Public Opinion, Environmental Politics, and Political Economy**, with the regional focus on China. I use applied econometrics to uncover the role of information, trauma experience, and cultural norms in shaping political attitudes and decision making.

## Working Papers
- Pollution Matters: The Political Cost of Information Disclosure (First and Corresponding author with [Xiaoxiao Shen](https://xiaoxiaoshen.co/) and Andong Zhuge). Revise and resubmit, [[ssrn]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4486089).
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
 This paper examines the causal impact of information disclosure on political trust and provides a possible psychological mechanism through which the effect occurred. Using a Difference-in-Difference strategy, this paper examines the causal effect of environmental information disclosure on political trust, by looking into a staggered rolled-out implementation of a national program in China that provides real-time air-pollution information to the public. We found that the information disclosure had a significantly positive impact on citizens’ political trust. However, this positive “disclosure effect” was moderated by the local pollution levels residents were exposed to. Notably and surprisingly, the adverse impact was more pronounced for less polluted areas. Our heterogeneity analysis also showed that the effect is more pronounced among middle-aged, internet using, and urban residents with children. Furthermore, we established that the causal effect operated through the channels of citizens’ mental well-being, demonstrated by a large and statistically significant increase in the risk of mild depression and self-dissatisfaction.

- Land Reform, Emerging Grassroots Democracy and Political Trust: Evidence from China’s Collective Forest Tenure Reform (First author  with [Yuanyuan Yi](https://sites.google.com/view/yuanyuanyi/home), [Jintao Xu](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/x/239550.htm) and Andong Zhuge). submitted.[[ssrn]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4569967) [[CCER讨论稿]](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/cbw/tlg1/tlg2023/532016.htm)
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This study explores how the application of democratic rule in land reform decision-making process determines villagers’ political trust towards different levels of the cadres in rural China. Based on analyses of a two-period household survey, we find that in China’s most recent Collective Forest Tenure Reform, the use of democratic rule improves villagers’ trust for town and county cadres, whereas the impact on trust towards village cadres is only significant for the highest democraticness that involves mass participation. This pattern of trust is partly explained by that the democratic process helped decrease the unresolved inter-village forestland disputes which usually requires town or county level cadres’ intervene, whilst there seems no such impact on the within-village land disputes. Heterogeneity analyses show that democratic decision-making has a more pronounced effect in improving trust for villagers with lower income, and those without affiliation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or to the village committee. Our results provide the first evidence that Chinese people perceive democracy not only as a way to select their leaders, but also ways for ordinary people to participate in public affairs and present their opinions in decision-making process to influence local cadres’ accountability.

- Historical Trauma Matters: Evidence from Over-Saving Fiscal Expenditure Behaviour in Local Officials in China (Corresponding author with Andong Zhuge). 
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   Little attention has been paid to how officials’ personal trauma experience shapes their fiscal expenditure efficiency, which is fundamental for local government performance. We investigate the impact of childhood famine trauma on the propensity for an “over-saving” fiscal expenditure behaviour among local government officials. Analyzing panel data from 300 Chinese cities between 2005 and 2018, we find that officials imprinted with childhood famine trauma will exhibit more conservative and risk-averse fiscal behaviors in their jurisdictions, leading to increased Year-End Spending Surges (YESS), which refers to the phenomenon of rushing to exhaust unused budgets at year end. Moreover, this imprinting effect leads to reduced GDP growth rate and fiscal efficiency. Furthermore, this imprinting effect is mostly profound for officials those aged 3 to 8 during the famine in their most impressionable year. Moreover, a lack of STEM education, working in cities with advanced economic development, and extensive local networks accentuate this effect. We explore the psychological mechanism underlying this effect, demonstrated by the emergence of mild depression for this specific group.

- Self-Censorship, Citizen Compliance, and Public Opinion Dynamics: A Study on China's Zero-COVID Transition(First author  with [Jiakun Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=c-6NWRcAAAAJ), [Jianhua Xu](https://www.ghd.pku.edu.cn/English/People/Faculty_fe5100f8d50a4875a92ad8991380a172/X_fe5100f8d50a4875a92ad8991380a172/XUjianhua/index.blk.htm) and [Yana Jin](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/yjin/bio)). 
    <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
    This study investigates the prevalence of self-censorship among the Chinese and its impact on public policy support. Specifically, we explore the characteristics of individuals who tend to self-censor and endorse public policies blindly, as opposed to those who rationally assess the policy in light of changing circumstances. We focuse on the controversial zero-COVID policy, which was in place for nearly three years before a sudden governmental shift to  living-with-COVID. We examine how individuals perceived this abrupt shift once the pressure of self-censorship was alleviated. By assessing whether individuals' perceptions of policy cost-benefit changes align with their evolving policy preferences, we find that individuals with lower levels of education, lower income, and religious affiliations demonstrate unwavering support for policies. Intriguingly, affiliation with the China Communist Party does not necessarily indicate unwavering support. We provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of self-censorship and public opinion dynamics in China.

- Learning through infection (corresponding author with Yana Jin, Jiakun Zheng, and Jianhua Xu).
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This paper investigates how individual-level infection experiences shape mass support for the restrictive policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Grounded in theories of affect and decision making, we test our hypotheses in China using panel data which allow us to identify the role of infection in support for restrictive policies while controlling for individual heterogeneity. We find that experiencing infection of Covid-19 had a negative impact on supporting restrictive measures (zero-COVID policy), whereas infection severity moderated this effect, with individuals who had severe infections showing heightened support for the zero-Covid and a decreased tolerance for risk. This shift can be attributed to people updating their perceptions of costs and benefits of live-with-Covid during their infection. Interestingly, heterogeneity analysis shows that the “learning” effects are most pronounced among Han ethnicity males who do not have religious affiliations, have high incomes, and are not affiliated with the China Communist Party (CCP). These findings shed light on the experience mechanism by which citizens swiftly change their policy preference in response to health risks.

- The Voice of Extravagance(corresponding author with Renji Zhou).
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary>
   This study examines the impact of non-political media on long-term political attitudes by exploiting the unintended introduction of cross-border TV signal in the early 1980s in China. We find that rural residents in counties with better Hong Kong free-to-air TV (HKTV) signals have lower political trust towards local governments. The effect persists for two decades and is driven by heavy TV viewers, namely the cohorts exposed to HKTV during their adolescence, but this effect would be mitigated by media censorship. Regarding possible mechanisms, we find that individuals exposed to entertainment TV as children were more cognitively sophisticated and civic-minded as adults.
